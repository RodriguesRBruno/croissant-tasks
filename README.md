# Croissant Tasks Examples
This repository contains standarized Croissant Task examples for three different use cases: a data processing task (DICOM to NIfTI conversion for medical images), a Benchmark, loosely based on the [MLCommons AILuminate Benchmark](https://mlcommons.org/ailuminate/) and another benchmark loosely based on the MLCommons MLPerf Benchmark. All examples are hypothetical and do **NOT** constitute complete use cases. For all use cases, both a Croissant Task Problemn, a Croissant Task Solution and a Croissant Task Instance example are provided. Someone can define a Croissant Task Problem, leaving in specifications for data, assets and/or implementations that must be provided as part of corresponding Task Solutions. This Task Problem may then be shared with a large community, from which other users can generate their own Croissant Task Problem solutions. Data, assets and/or implementations from the Solutions should conform to the specification of the Croissant Task Problem, even though they will differ in each Solution. Finally, when executing a given solution on real data, a Task Instance is generated as a record of that execution.

**NOTE** Currently, only the data processing example is up-to-date with the latest developments of the Croissant Task format.
